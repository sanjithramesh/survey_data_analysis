# survey_data_analysis
The goal of this project to understand if the pandemic caused major societal changes in different segments of the population. To do that we analyze stack overflow survey data trends for years 2019,2020 and 2021. Data collection has varied over these 3 years so finding the right questions to answer was half the challenge. Not all questions had continuity over the 3 years. I have segmented the population into bins of age groups to better understand changes in different cohorts of the population.

This repo consists of two main files:
1. Python analysis
2. Tableau analysis

Please note certain questions are answered only in Tableau due to the easy of visualizing data. The fundamental analysis done in both is the same. However the tableau analysis is more detailed, complete and answers questions at a more granular level.

I also have a medium post that answers some questions from dataset - https://medium.com/@sanjithramesh96/will-everyone-know-how-to-code-in-the-next-10-years-a3ebfdb3f19b
